## 1. Introduction

Chonggong (총공), romanized as 'chong-gong' and translating roughly to "total attack" or "all-out offensive," is a term deeply embedded in K-pop fandom culture, referring to the coordinated mass efforts of fans to support their favorite artists. These efforts predominantly involve streaming music videos on platforms like YouTube and Spotify, voting in various online polls and award ceremonies, and trending specific hashtags on social media platforms such as Twitter (now X). Chonggong represents a powerful display of collective fan dedication and a significant driving force behind an artist’s chart performance, award recognition, and overall public image. It's more than just casual support; it is strategic, organized, and often involves significant time and effort from participating fans. The term reflects the highly competitive nature of the K-pop industry, where artists are constantly vying for attention and recognition, and where fans actively participate in these competitions on behalf of their idols.

The concept goes beyond mere support. It is a highly structured and organized undertaking, often involving dedicated teams, detailed schedules, and specific goals. Fans will create tutorials, share tips, and offer encouragement to ensure that the chonggong is as effective as possible. The intensity of a chonggong can vary greatly, depending on the occasion, the artist’s standing, and the competitiveness of the particular event or award. A debut, comeback, or major award show will typically trigger a particularly intense chonggong.

Understanding chonggong is crucial for anyone seeking to comprehend the inner workings of K-pop fandom. It reveals the proactive role fans play in shaping the trajectory of their favorite artists' careers. It also highlights the influence of social media and digital platforms in the K-pop industry and the creative ways fans leverage these tools to amplify their support.

## 2. Etymology

The term "chonggong" (총공) is derived from the Korean words "총" (chong), meaning "total" or "all," and "공격" (gonggyeok), meaning "attack" or "offensive." Combined, they form a compound noun that literally translates to "total attack." However, within the context of K-pop fandom, it has evolved to represent a concerted, all-out effort.

The use of "attack" might seem aggressive at first glance, but it's important to understand the context. The term doesn't imply violence or harm. Rather, it conveys the sense of a strategic and determined push to achieve a specific goal. In the competitive landscape of K-pop, where success is often measured by metrics like chart rankings and award wins, fans perceive their efforts as a battle, and chonggong is their coordinated strategy to win.

The aggressive terminology highlights the perceived stakes involved. K-pop is not just about music; it's a cultural phenomenon and a career path for the artists involved. Fans feel a deep sense of responsibility to support their idols and help them achieve their dreams. The term "chonggong" reflects this intensity and the high expectations associated with K-pop fandom. It is a statement of dedication and a willingness to go the extra mile for their favorite artists.

Furthermore, the word "chonggong" also carries the connotation of unity and collaboration. It suggests that fans are working together as a single, cohesive force. This sense of community is a central aspect of K-pop fandom, and chonggong is a prime example of how fans come together to achieve a common goal. The shared purpose and the collective effort create a strong bond among fans and strengthen their connection to the artist.

## 3. Usage

Chonggong is typically utilized in various situations crucial to an artist's success and visibility. The most common usages include:

*   **Music Video Streaming:** Increasing the view count of official music videos on platforms like YouTube is a primary goal. Fans create playlists, follow specific streaming guidelines (volume level, watch time, intervals, etc.), and use multiple devices to maximize the views. The aim is to break records, chart higher on YouTube's trending charts, and increase the overall visibility of the artist. This is often organized in shifts, with fans dedicating certain hours of the day to streaming.

*   **Voting in Polls and Award Shows:** K-pop relies heavily on fan votes for determining the winners of various awards and popularity polls. Chonggong efforts are directed towards strategically mobilizing fans to vote, often involving creating multiple accounts, using VPNs to bypass geographical restrictions, and following specific voting guidelines to maximize impact. Tutorials and guides are readily shared to ensure everyone participates effectively. These award shows can significantly boost an artist's career and recognition, making the voting process crucial.

*   **Trending Hashtags on Social Media:** Fans coordinate to trend specific hashtags related to an artist's comeback, birthday, or other significant event. This involves posting frequently using the designated hashtag, creating engaging content, and encouraging other fans to participate. Trending hashtags increase visibility on social media platforms and help generate buzz around the artist. The goal is often to get the hashtag trending worldwide, showcasing the global reach of the fandom.

*   **Boosting Digital Sales:** While not always explicitly called "chonggong," coordinated efforts to buy digital music on platforms like iTunes and Melon (a Korean streaming service) are a common occurrence. Fans may pool resources to purchase multiple copies of a song or album, aiming to propel the artist to the top of the charts. This requires creating accounts on the relevant platforms and sometimes navigating language barriers.

*   **Pre-Saving and Pre-Adding Songs:** Before a song's release, fans will often be encouraged to pre-save on Spotify or pre-add on Apple Music. These actions count towards first-day streaming numbers and are seen as crucial to a successful launch. Coordination involves sharing links and reminders to encourage widespread participation.

*   **Promoting on Korean Music Streaming Platforms:** Streaming on Korean music platforms like Melon, Genie, and Bugs! is paramount for charting well in Korea. Since these platforms often require Korean phone numbers and identification, international fans work together with Korean fans to coordinate streaming efforts. They also work to find guides and tutorials for international fans to navigate these platforms.

*   **Album Sales:** Coordinating album purchases is a major part of chonggong. Fans pool money together, or create group orders, to buy albums in bulk. There is often the goal of breaking pre-order records, first week sales records, and overall album sales records. This helps the artist chart highly on physical album charts, such as the Gaon (Circle) Chart in Korea.

The key element in all these usages is the coordination and organization. It's not just about individual fans supporting their artist; it's about fans working together towards a shared goal. This often involves creating dedicated teams, setting up communication channels (e.g., Discord servers, Telegram groups), and developing detailed strategies.

## 4. Examples

Several real-world examples demonstrate the impact and intensity of chonggong in K-pop fandom:

*   **BTS's ARMY:** The ARMY, BTS's dedicated fanbase, is renowned for its highly organized and effective chonggong efforts. They have consistently broken streaming records on YouTube, dominated voting polls for numerous award shows, and successfully trended countless hashtags. Their organized approach serves as a benchmark for other fandoms. For example, before the release of a new song, the ARMY organizes global streaming parties. These parties set a timer for when the song will be released and provide detailed instructions on how to best stream the song, what volume to stream at, and what playlists to use.

*   **BLACKPINK's BLINK:** BLINKs have also demonstrated formidable chonggong power, particularly in supporting BLACKPINK's music releases and award nominations. They are known for their strategic voting efforts and their ability to mobilize fans worldwide. In addition to streaming and voting, BLINK also engages in promoting the group's image and brand. They coordinate to ensure that the group's image is presented in a positive light.

*   **TWICE's ONCE:** ONCEs have consistently supported TWICE's comebacks with well-coordinated streaming and voting campaigns. Their efforts have contributed significantly to TWICE's success in Korea and internationally. Before comebacks, ONCE will share streaming guides and tutorials in many different languages to help international fans stream and vote more effectively.

*   **EXO's EXO-L:** EXO-Ls are well-known for their dedication to both digital and physical album sales. They have consistently broken album sales records and have actively participated in streaming and voting activities. EXO-L showcases their chonggong by coordinating group orders to buy albums, and hosting listening parties where fans listen to the albums together.

*   **During Award Season:** Award shows like the Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA), the Melon Music Awards (MMA), and the Golden Disc Awards (GDA) often trigger intense chonggong efforts. Fandoms dedicate significant resources to encouraging fans to vote, often employing strategies like creating multiple accounts and using VPNs.

*   **Social Media Campaigns:** When an artist faces criticism or controversy, fans often launch hashtag campaigns to show their support and defend their idol. These campaigns aim to counteract negative narratives and promote positive messages. A strong example includes fans trending supportive hashtags after an artist received hate comments online.

These examples illustrate the diverse ways in which chonggong manifests in K-pop fandom. They highlight the dedication, organization, and collective power of fans, and demonstrate the significant impact that chonggong can have on an artist's career.
