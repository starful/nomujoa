## 1. Introduction

Streaming, known as *seuming* (스밍) in Korean, is a fundamental practice within K-pop fandom culture. It goes beyond simply listening to music; it is a dedicated, strategic, and often meticulously planned activity undertaken by fans to boost the chart performance of their favorite artists. The primary goal of streaming is to increase the number of streams a song or album receives on various online music platforms, which directly impacts an artist's ranking on music charts (both domestic and international), influences music show wins, and ultimately contributes to their overall success and recognition.

The significance of streaming in K-pop is deeply intertwined with the industry's competitive landscape and the importance of quantifiable success. In a saturated market with numerous artists vying for attention, high chart rankings are crucial for visibility, media coverage, and securing commercial opportunities. Streaming, therefore, becomes a vital tool for fans to actively demonstrate their support and contribute to their artist's achievements.

The culture of streaming is characterized by a complex interplay of organized efforts, individual commitment, and technological awareness. Fans often form streaming teams, create detailed guides, and utilize various strategies to maximize the impact of their streaming efforts. This includes understanding platform-specific rules, optimizing streaming playlists, and coordinating streaming schedules. Furthermore, streaming has evolved alongside the advancements in technology, with fans constantly adapting their methods to comply with platform updates and algorithms.

While streaming is undoubtedly a powerful tool for fans to support their artists, it also raises questions about the authenticity of chart performance and the potential for manipulation. The emphasis on streaming can sometimes overshadow other aspects of fandom, such as album sales, voting, and genuine appreciation for the music. Despite these debates, streaming remains an integral part of the K-pop ecosystem and a key indicator of fan dedication and collective power.

## 2. Etymology

The term "스밍" (*seuming*) is a Konglish word, derived directly from the English word "streaming." It represents the phonetical adaptation of "streaming" into the Korean language. Konglish words are common in South Korea and are formed by combining English words with Korean grammar or pronunciation.

While the English term "streaming" generally refers to the act of listening to or watching media online without downloading it, in the context of K-pop, "스밍" (*seuming*) has taken on a more specific and active connotation. It implies a deliberate and repeated action aimed at influencing chart performance.

The adoption of the term "스밍" (*seuming*) highlights the global influence of the internet and the role of technology in shaping K-pop culture. It also reflects the Korean entertainment industry's embrace of Western concepts and technologies, while simultaneously adapting them to its own unique context.

Prior to the widespread adoption of streaming platforms, fans relied on physical album sales and radio airplay to support their favorite artists. However, with the rise of digital music consumption, streaming has become the primary method of gauging popularity and influencing chart rankings, leading to the emergence of the term "스밍" (*seuming*) and its associated practices.

## 3. Usage

In the K-pop fandom, the term "스밍" (*seuming*) is used extensively in various contexts, including:

*   **Instructions and Guides:** Fans often create detailed "스밍 가이드" (*seuming guide*) that provide step-by-step instructions on how to effectively stream a song or album on specific platforms. These guides typically outline the optimal playlist configuration, streaming schedule, and platform-specific rules to maximize impact.

*   **Organized Streaming Projects:** Fans organize "스밍 총공" (*seuming chonggong*), which translates to "streaming general attack" or "streaming mass effort." These are coordinated efforts where fans collectively stream a song or album at a specific time to boost its chart performance.

*   **Motivation and Encouragement:** Fans use phrases like "스밍하자!" (*seuming haja!*), meaning "Let's stream!" to encourage each other to participate in streaming activities. They also share tips and tricks to optimize their streaming efforts and stay motivated.

*   **Bragging and Achievement:** Fans proudly share their streaming statistics and achievements, such as the number of streams they have contributed or the chart rankings their artist has achieved, using phrases like "스밍 인증" (*seuming injeung*), meaning "streaming proof."

*   **Criticism and Scrutiny:** The term "스밍" (*seuming*) can also be used critically to question the authenticity of chart performance or to highlight the potential downsides of excessive streaming. For example, concerns about "스밍 조작" (*seuming jojak*), meaning "streaming manipulation," are sometimes raised when unusual streaming patterns are observed.

**Specific Streaming Strategies and Terminology:**

*   **1시간 1스밍 (1 sigan 1 seuming):** This phrase means "1 stream per hour" and refers to a common streaming strategy aimed at maximizing chart performance. The idea is to space out streams to avoid being filtered out by the platform's algorithms, which often prioritize unique listeners over repeated listens within a short period.

*   **스밍리스트 (seuming riseuteu):** This refers to a streaming playlist that is carefully curated to optimize streaming efficiency. The playlist typically includes the target song along with other tracks by the same artist or different artists to avoid repetitive listening patterns.

*   **무한 스밍 (muhan seuming):** This means "infinite streaming" and refers to the act of continuously streaming a song or album without interruption. While this may seem like an effective strategy, it can sometimes be counterproductive, as platforms may filter out streams that appear to be bot-generated.

*   **스밍 횟수 (seuming hoessu):** This refers to the number of times a song or album has been streamed. Fans often track their "스밍 횟수" (*seuming hoessu*) to monitor their progress and contribute to overall streaming goals.

*   **음원 사이트 (eumwon saiteu):** This refers to music streaming websites or platforms, such as Melon, Genie, Bugs, FLO, Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music. Each platform has its own unique rules and algorithms, and fans often tailor their streaming strategies accordingly.

*   **국내 스밍 (guknae seuming):** This refers to streaming activities focused on domestic (Korean) music platforms. Domestic charts, such as Melon's chart, are particularly important for securing music show wins and achieving mainstream recognition in Korea.

*   **해외 스밍 (haeoe seuming):** This refers to streaming activities focused on international music platforms, such as Spotify and Apple Music. International charts, such as the Billboard charts, are important for global recognition and expanding an artist's fanbase beyond Korea.

**Social Media Usage:**

The term "스밍" (*seuming*) is frequently used on social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and fan communities to share streaming updates, coordinate streaming projects, and motivate fellow fans. Hashtags like #스밍인증, #스밍총공, and #[ArtistName]STREAMING are commonly used to organize and amplify streaming efforts.
